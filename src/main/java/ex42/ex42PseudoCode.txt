1) start the program and create a class called App that will have the program within it
and will utilise the java.util*; and the java.io.*; as main imports.

2) The class App will have two methods, the main method which will represent a driver method
and the ArrayList<String> type method called InputHandler, which takes as a parameter
a string storing the input file directory.

3) By starting the program the main method is called where the InputHandler method is called while passing the input file
directory to the method which returns an array list that contains the information scanned from the input file through
the use of loops, bufferedReader tool and also with exception handling using a try catch approach.

4) After the array list of type String is returned to main, the elements of the list will be printed
following the specific format specified by the assignment, through the use of arrays with the .split(",") tool
to separate the elements of the list separated by a comma and then store them within the array. In addition, the method
uses loops along with a String.format() tool to print with respect to the expected format of output.

5) End of the program
