1) start the program and create a class called App that will have the program within it
and will utilise the java.util*; and the java.io.*; as main imports.

2) The class has 5 methods: main, (void) handleFileGeneratorDecisions, (String) htmlGenerator,(String) cssGenerator
 and (String) jsGenerator.

3) First the main method is called, where the user is prompted for the website name
and its author along with the choice to either have a JavaScript folder and CSS folder
or no. Depending on the answer the JSCHOICE and CSSCHOICE boolean variables are either
set to true when the user affirms their need of those folders, or they are set to false
if they say no.

4) within the main method the handleFileGeneratorDecisions method is called which takes
the scanned website name, author name, JSCHOICE, CSSCHOICE along with the current work directory.

5) The handleFileGeneratorDecisions method updates the directory to create a new
folder within it called "website" and prints that it was created with its directory,
then it calls the htmlGenerator function to create the html file
which takes the name variable, author variable and the updated directory where the index.html
will be created. The method also calls the jsGenerator function and the cssGenerator
methods depending on  if the user wants a JS or CSS file.

6) The htmlGenerator when called will generate an index.html file with written information within it
as requested in the format specified by the assignment. The method uses BufferedWriter tool
and String.format() tools.

7) when called the jsGenerator and cssGenerator will generate js and css folders accordingly
and output a message in the form of "created: + directory". These methods take the updated directory
as a parameter and use .mkdirs() to check if the folder was generated then output a success message
or throw an exception through the try catch approach in case there was an error.

8) at the end all three functions return there newDirectory where the files/folders were created and these
are mainly just for testing purpose.

9) End of the program
