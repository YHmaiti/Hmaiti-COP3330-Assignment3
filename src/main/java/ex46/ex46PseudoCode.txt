1) Start within the class App that contains the program

2) The class App contains two methods, main and Map<String, Integer> InputHandler. The class
and program rely on two imports import java.io.*; and import java.util.*;

3) The program starts by going to main where we build our input directory string containing the input
file directory  then we use a bufferedReader tool and FileReader tool to scan information from the
input file that we store continuously within an array list. Then we call the InputHandler and pass
the input list.

4) The InputHandler function that creates a map with the key as the word itself and the value
is the frequency of that word, then returns the map to main where we use Collections.sort() to sort both
the words and their values (frequency) then use for loops to print the word and its frequency
in order from high to low.

5) both methods in the class use try catch approaches to handle exceptions.

6) end of the program
