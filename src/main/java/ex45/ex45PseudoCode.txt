1) start the program and create a class called App that will have the program within it
and will utilise the java.util*; and the java.io.*; as main imports.

2) The class has three methods, main, ArrayList<String> getInput, and void UpdateOutput

3) The main method is called first, where we build a string that stores the input file
directory and prompts the user for the outputfile name desired and then updates the output directory
using the scanned outputfile name.

4) Main calls the getInput method that takes the input file directory and returns the input
file scanned information as an array list of type string using a bufferedReader tool and using
try catch exception handling approach.

5) After the array list is returned to main, it will be passed within the call of the UpdateOutput
method, which will use the arraylist passed to it along with the output directory to iterate through
the list and change the word "utilize" to "use" and then print the output successively to the screen and
to the output file using the outputfile passed to the method.

6) end of the program
