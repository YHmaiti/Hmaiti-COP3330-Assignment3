1) start the program and create a class called App that will have the program within it
and will utilise the com.google.gson.*; java.util*; and the java.io.*; as main imports.

2) The class contains two methods: main and (int) JSONCHECKER, which takes as parameters
the product name and the directory where the JSON file is.

3) At the start the main method is called where we will store the directory of the input
JSON file as a string that we will pass to the JSONCHECKER method along with the prompted
product name from the user. The main method uses a while loop that runs until the user enters
a valid product name present within the input file.

4) when called the JSONCHECKER method uses a Gson and Reader tools, JsonElement and JsonObject to find the
product within the JSON file through using a while loop to go through the JSON file elements that will
be stored in a temporary JsonArray to make it easy to iterate through the products.

5) The JSONCHECKER uses a try catch approach and throw FileNotFoundException
to catch exceptions when reading from the JSON file and either prints the product
and its characteristics when found along with returning 1,
otherwise it just returns 0 when the product is not found.

6) after returning 1 or 0, this value is checked in main method to either continue looping if it is 0,
otherwise the program ends.

7) end of the program
