1) start the program and create a class called App that will have the program within it
and will utilise the java.util*; and the java.io.*; as main imports.

2) create two methods within the class, a main method that represents a driver method and
an ArrayList<String> method called InputHandlerWithSort that takes the input and output directories
as parameters of type String.

3) After we start the program, the main method will be called where we call the
InputHandlerWithSort function that will get the input and output directories from main,
then it will read the input file and store the information
sorted within an arraylist that it will return to main using through the use of
Collections.sort() tool to sort.

4) The method InputHandlerWithSort uses buffered writer and reader tools in addition to
try catch approach to handle any exceptions and loops. The method will also print to the output file
based on the required exercise output format desired.

5) After returning the arraylist to main, the output will be then printed to the screen
according to the desired format.

6) the printing process will rely on a printOutput function that is designed just for printing
purpose and takes a string as a parameter

7) end of the program
